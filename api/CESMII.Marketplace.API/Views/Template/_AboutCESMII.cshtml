        In support of Smart Manufacturing, the CESMII website supports Smart Manufacturing Profiles&trade;. These are innovative, structured information models created to represent operational data.
        The use of smart manufacturing profiles enables the building of work flows for moving "data-in-context" from source to consumption,
        and between components that consume the data as part of a smart manufacturing solution.

    <p>
        Start building your own Smart Manufacturing Profile&trade; by logging into the CESMII website and accessing the  <a href="https://profiledesigner.cesmii.net" >Smart Manufacturing Profile&trade; Designer</a>.
        After you have completed your Smart Manufacturing Profile, you can give the world access by publishing it in the <a href="https://marketplace.cesmii.net">CESMII Smart Manufacturing Marketplace</a>.
