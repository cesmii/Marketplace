        In support of Smart Manufacturing, the CESMII website supports Smart Manufacturing Profiles&trade;. These are innovative, structured information models created to represent operational data.
        The use of smart manufacturing profiles enables the building of work flows for moving "data-in-context" from source to consumption,
        and between components that consume the data as part of a smart manufacturing solution.
